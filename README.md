## before we begin 

Think of past 4 projects, how organized were we? What could we have done better in terms of the organization? 
> (think pair share)



## Lets expand! 
Quick maffs. think of a start up, 10-15 people, some amazing app. Theres probably some marketing, a product lead, some devs and a ceo. 
Price of a software dev is anywhere from 50k(early dev) to 160k(senior dev). in a team of 5 devs, at the lowest your spending 20,833 to 66,000 a month for software development. Now picture youre the investor. DO you want to see progress asap, or after 4 months? 
That is a _lot_ of money going in. Whats the best *software development lifecycle* a company should have?? 

        
## agile manifesto
[The Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/)
there was a meeting in 2001 where a bunch of developers came up with another solution to how to better work together and what the _rhythm_ should be.
"In software development, *agile* approaches development requirements and solutions through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customer/end user" 


## Scrum? 
Scrum is a flavor of Agile. 
Weekly efficient meetings involving the Scrum Master, Product Lead, Client and Software Dev Team. In these meetings we discuss our product backlog, the point system and where to focus our time. 





## what methodologies did we have before?
